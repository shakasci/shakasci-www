      <P>
      Supply:
      <P>
      BEFORE YOU FILL IN THE SECURE ORDER FORM, COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE BELOW.
      ONCE THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN FINALISED, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE YOUR
      ORDER.
      <P>
      It is recommended that you contact me with details of your router,
      in order to ascertain whether the standard jig will be suitable for your
      router, or whether you would require a customised jig. While we have endeavoured
      to cater for as many routers as possible, it is physically impossible to
      cover every brand/model. For this reason, we are prepared to provide a
      customising service for a limited time. The brands covered, but by no means
      comprehensive, are DeWalt/Elu, Hitachi, Makita, Porter Cable, Bosch and
      Ryobi.
      <P>
      There are three types of router mounting:<BR>
      <B>Type A</B> routers have additional threaded holes which can be used for
      mounting the SPARC JIG as an Auxillary baseplate.<BR>
      <B>Type B</B> requires the replacement of the current baseplate with the
      SPARC JIG.<BR>
      <B>Type T</B> mounts are threaded holes on the baseplate for mounting template
      guides, are usually located close to the centre, and can be used for mounting
      the SPARC JIG. This is particularly useful if the SPARC JIG is to be used
      only temporarily.
      <P>
      Below is a list of the specific routers that may be immediately mounted
      on the JIG, together with the types of mountings provided: DeWalt DW621,
      DW625/Elu MOF177 (A,T); Hitachi TR12, M12V (B,T), TR8, M8V (T); Porter Cable
      PC7539, PC7529, PC7519*, PC7536* (B); Bosch GOF1300ACE (B), POF400 (A,T),
      POF500A (T); Makita 3612C, 3612, 3620 (B), 3601* (B); Ryobi R155, R500, R502
      (T), RE600NA (T). SPARC JIG can be customised for all other routers. We welcome
      your specific queries via
      <A HREF="mailto:shakasci.nz@gmail.com">email</A>.
      <P>
      The Custom SPARC JIG will be supplied either predrilled for your router,
      or as a blank for you to drill. The lead-time is 2 weeks. The locations of
      the existing list of routers will remain as 1 mm holes; so should you acquire
      one of the listed routers at a later date, the respective holes can be opened
      up for your new router. Custom Jigs are NON-RETURNABLE.
      <P>
      While these JIGS are recommended to be used with plunge routers,
      non-plunge routers can be used with care. DISCLAIMER: WE CANNOT ACCEPT ANY
      RESPONSIBLILTY FOR ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES THAT MAY OCCUR WHILE USING A NON-PLUNGE
      ROUTER WITH THE SPARC JIG.
      <P>
      <B>As an INTRODUCTORY OFFER, the Standard and Deluxe SPARC JIG kits
      will be shipped BY FREE AIR INTERNATIONAL WORLDWIDE DELIVERY, while the optional
      accessories will incur a separate freight charge, unless ordered with a
      kit.</B>

      <P>
       If you are not sure about sending your credit card number over the
      Internet, then you can use one of these methods:
      <P>
       1. Print and complete the Order Form and fax me the details at +64+9
      521 5032. '64' in the country code for New Zealand, '9' is the city code
      for Auckland. We will be able to accept faxes between the hours 1200-2400
      GMT, 0700-1900 (NY), 0400-1600 (LA), 2000-0800 (Singapore), 2200-1000 (Sydney).
      Please email me once you have sent the fax. Should you wish to send me a
      fax outside these hours, email me first.
      <P>
       2. Send me the details piecemeal over a number of days. For example,
      send me the first 4 numbers the first day, the third 4 numbers the next,
      etc, then tell me the order you have sent them.
      <P>
       3. Add a number to the credit card number and send me this number
      in a separate email. For example, add 0101010101010101 to your credit card
      number.
      <P>
       4. Shuffle the blocks of 4 numbers around. For example, if your number
      is 1234 5678 9012 3456, send me 1234 9012 3456 5678, then in a later email
      send me 1342 so I know which order you have sent the numbers.
      <P>
       Please remember that New Zealand is the first country to see the
      new day, and was the first to see the new millennium. In relation to other
      cities around the world, Auckland is:
      <P>
       20 hours ahead of Los Angeles<BR>
      17 hours ahead of New York<BR>
      12 hours ahead of London<BR>
      4 hours ahead of Singapore<BR>
      2 hours ahead of Sydney
      <P>
